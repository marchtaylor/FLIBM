Description: The FLIBM model is developed along the lines of the 
    FLR framework (Fisheries Library for R) <http://www.flr-project.org/>, 
    and uses FLStock objects to record the state of the simulated stock.
    Through use of an individual-based model (IBM) allows for the generation of
    non-age-based stock indices (e.g. based on length), which are commonly 
    used in data-limited stock assessment approaches. Presently, 
    individual variation is modelled for the processes of growth, 
    through variation in growth function parameters, and mortality, 
    through treatment of rates (natural and fishing mortality) 
    as probabilties of dying.
